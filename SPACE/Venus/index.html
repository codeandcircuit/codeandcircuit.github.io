	Venus was always mysterious to the world, before 1982 we had never even seen throught its atmosphere. Nobody knew what lied below its carbon cover, with many people having absolutely insane ideas. For example, many thought that there might have been another society like our own, or of aliens. Some film producers even made movies showing prehistoric animals or aliens living there. Some even imagined more humans living there. After 1982, however, we saw the surface, and all of these theories were disproven.

	Due to an extreme greenhouse effect from the atmosphere's large amount of carbon, surface temperatures of venus is on average four hundred sixty two degrees celcius!()
